# generator-of-passwords
Hello  I'm LOST ! 

This is one of my first little project. I hope you will enjoy !

This program is a generator of passwords. You can choose the size of your password and the program will create one for you.
Some packages must to be download to run this program :
- colorama
- time
- random
- sys

The only one you need to install is 'colorama', the other one are installed by default.
To install it, open your command prompt and run 'pip install colorama'. If it doesn't work, add your version of python for exemple 'pip3.10 install colorama'
If you can't install this package, don't panick, it's just for the style, so you can edit my code.
Delete :
"from colorama import Fore, Style" (line21)
"Fore.MAGENTA +" (line 62)
"print(Style.RESET_ALL)" (line 71)
", Fore.MAGENTA +" (line 96)
", Style.RESET_ALL" (line 96)


THANKS FOR YOUR DOWNLOAD.\n
